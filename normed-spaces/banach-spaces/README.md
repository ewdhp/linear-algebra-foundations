# Banach Spaces

## 📖 What You'll Learn

Banach spaces are complete normed vector spaces that generalize Hilbert spaces by dropping the requirement of an inner product. They provide the natural setting for studying optimization, functional analysis, and many aspects of modern machine learning, especially when inner product structure is unavailable or unnecessary.

### Core Concepts

1. **Banach Space Definition**
   - Normed vector space (V, ‖·‖) that is complete
   - Completeness: Every Cauchy sequence converges in V
   - More general than Hilbert spaces (no inner product required)
   - Examples: Lp spaces for p ≠ 2, C[a,b], spaces of matrices

2. **Classic Examples**
   - **ℝⁿ with any norm**: Always complete (finite-dimensional)
   - **Lp spaces**: {f : ∫|f|ᵖ < ∞} with ‖f‖ₚ = (∫|f|ᵖ)^(1/p)
   - **L∞ space**: Essentially bounded functions
   - **C[a,b]**: Continuous functions with sup norm
   - **ℓp spaces**: Sequences with Σ|xᵢ|ᵖ < ∞
   - **Sobolev spaces**: Functions with weak derivatives in Lp

3. **Dual Spaces**
   - Dual space V*: All continuous linear functionals on V
   - Dual norm: ‖φ‖* = sup{|φ(x)| : ‖x‖ ≤ 1}
   - Bidual space V**: Dual of V*
   - Reflexive spaces: V ≅ V** (e.g., Lp for 1 < p < ∞)
   - Non-reflexive: L1, L∞, C[a,b]

4. **Bounded Linear Operators**
   - T : V → W is bounded if ‖T‖ = sup{‖Tx‖ : ‖x‖ ≤ 1} < ∞
   - Equivalent to continuity in normed spaces
   - Space B(V,W) of bounded operators is Banach space
   - Composition and inverse operators

5. **Fundamental Theorems**
   - **Hahn-Banach Theorem**: Extending linear functionals
   - **Uniform Boundedness Principle**: Pointwise bounds imply uniform bound
   - **Open Mapping Theorem**: Surjective bounded operators are open
   - **Closed Graph Theorem**: Closed graph implies continuity
   - **Banach Fixed Point Theorem**: Contraction mapping principle

6. **Weak Convergence**
   - Strong convergence: ‖xₙ - x‖ → 0
   - Weak convergence: φ(xₙ) → φ(x) for all φ ∈ V*
   - Weak* convergence in dual spaces
   - Applications in optimization and calculus of variations

7. **Compactness**
   - Compact sets: Closed and bounded (finite-dim only)
   - Weak compactness: Bounded sets in reflexive spaces
   - Finite-dimensional subspaces
   - Compact operators and spectrum

## 📐 Mathematical Summary

### Key Definitions

**Banach Space:**
```
(V, ‖·‖) is Banach if:
1. V is vector space
2. ‖·‖ is a norm on V
3. V is complete (every Cauchy sequence converges)
```

**Dual Space:**
```
V* = {φ : V → ℝ | φ linear and continuous}

Dual norm: ‖φ‖* = sup{|φ(x)| : ‖x‖ ≤ 1}

For Lp: (Lp)* = Lq where 1/p + 1/q = 1
```

**Fundamental Theorems:**
```
Hahn-Banach: Can extend linear functionals preserving norm

Uniform Boundedness: 
sup_n ‖Tₙ‖ < ∞ if sup_n |Tₙ(x)| < ∞ for all x

Open Mapping: 
T : X → Y surjective bounded ⟹ T is open map

Banach Fixed Point:
T contraction on complete space ⟹ unique fixed point
```

**Weak Convergence:**
```
xₙ ⇀ x (weakly) if φ(xₙ) → φ(x) for all φ ∈ V*

Strong convergence: ‖xₙ - x‖ → 0 ⟹ weak convergence
(Converse false in infinite dimensions)
```

**Common Banach Spaces:**
```
Lp[a,b]: ‖f‖ₚ = (∫ₐᵇ |f|ᵖ dx)^(1/p)
L∞[a,b]: ‖f‖∞ = ess sup |f|
C[a,b]: ‖f‖∞ = max |f(x)|
Wᵏ,ᵖ: Sobolev space with k weak derivatives in Lp
```
