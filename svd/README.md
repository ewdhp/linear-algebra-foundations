# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

## ðŸ“– What You'll Learn

SVD is one of the most important matrix factorizations in ML/AI, generalizing eigendecomposition to any matrix:

### Core Concepts

1. **SVD Factorization**
   - Understanding A = UÎ£Váµ€
   - Left singular vectors (U): output space orthonormal basis
   - Singular values (Î£): importance/scaling factors (diagonal)
   - Right singular vectors (Váµ€): input space orthonormal basis

2. **Geometric Interpretation**
   - SVD as a sequence of transformations: rotation â†’ scaling â†’ rotation
   - How any linear transformation can be decomposed
   - Orthogonal bases for domain and codomain
   - Principal directions of stretching

3. **Computing SVD**
   - Relationship to eigendecomposition (Aáµ€A and AAáµ€)
   - Numerical algorithms for SVD
   - Computational complexity
   - Thin vs. full SVD

4. **Singular Values**
   - Ordering (largest to smallest)
   - Relationship to matrix rank
   - Condition number and numerical stability
   - Energy/information content

5. **Matrix Approximation**
   - Truncated SVD
   - Eckart-Young theorem (best low-rank approximation)
   - Reconstruction error
   - Choosing number of components

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Applications

### Low-Rank Approximation
