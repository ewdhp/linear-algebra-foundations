   - Computing similarity between vectors
   - Mathematical definition and properties
   - Applications in measuring alignment and projection

3. **Vector Norm (Length/Magnitude)**
   - L1 norm (Manhattan distance)
   - L2 norm (Euclidean distance)
   - Infinity norm and other norms
   - Normalization techniques

4. **Projection**
   - Projecting one vector onto another
