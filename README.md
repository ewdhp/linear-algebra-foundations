# Linear Algebra Foundations for ML/AI

Welcome to the **Linear Algebra Foundations** repository! This comprehensive guide covers the essential linear algebra concepts that every Machine Learning and AI practitioner must know.

## üìö Contents

This repository is organized into six core topics:

### 1. [Vectors](./vectors/)
- Represent data points, parameters, and embeddings
- Key concepts: dot product, norm, projection, orthogonality
- ML applications: cosine similarity for embeddings (e.g., word vectors)

### 2. [Matrices](./matrices/)
- Represent linear transformations, datasets, and neural network weight layers
- Key operations: multiplication, inverse, transpose, determinant
- ML applications: weight matrices in linear/fully connected layers

### 3. [Subspaces & Fundamental Theorem](./subspaces-fundamental-theorem/)
- Understand the four fundamental subspaces: null space, column space, row space, left null space
- Master the rank-nullity theorem: nullity + rank = dimension
- Key concepts: kernel, image, orthogonal complements, solvability
- ML applications: feature redundancy, information loss in neural networks, dimensionality analysis

### 4. [Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors](./eigenvalues-eigenvectors/)
- Solve Av = Œªv
- Interpret directions preserved under transformation with scaling factors
- ML applications: PCA (dimensionality reduction), stability analysis, spectral graph theory

### 5. [Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)](./svd/)
- Factorization A = UŒ£V·µÄ
- Orthogonal directions and singular values (importance weights)
- ML applications: low-rank approximation, model compression, latent factor models

### 6. [Tensor Decompositions](./tensor-decompositions/)
- Generalization of matrices to multi-dimensional arrays
- Examples: CP decomposition, Tucker decomposition
- ML applications: compressing deep networks, multi-modal data representation
